# Warming UP


1. The Python ecosystem uses tools such as linting (flake8, pylint), testing (pytest, unittest), and assembly (setuptools, wheel, pip) for linting, testing, and assembly as part of continuous integration (CI). CI/CD platforms, such as GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, are also used to manage the entire process.
2. Alternatives to Github Actions and Jankins are Gitlab CI/CD, Circle CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps, Teamcity, Bamboo. These tools offer different approaches to setup, integration with the ecosystem, and pricing, allowing you to choose a solution for specific tasks and preferences of the team.
3. The choice between on-premise and cloud options depends on your specific needs, budget, and security requirements.
   The local option is better if: you need full control over the data, strict security/regulatory requirements, and you have an IT team to maintain the infrastructure. This requires a lot of upfront costs.
   The cloud option is better if: flexibility, fast scaling, accessibility from anywhere in the world, and minimizing operational costs are important to you. The service provider handles the service.
   To make a decision, I need to know: what are you going to host, what are your security requirements, your budget, and whether you have IT specialists to support an on-site solution.
